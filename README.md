# IMDB Review Sentiment Classification  

This project focuses on building a **sentiment analysis** system to classify **IMDB reviews** as **positive** or **negative** using natural language processing (**NLP**) techniques. The system preprocesses text using tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization, and trains machine learning models like **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression** to achieve high accuracy.  

## Key Features  
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies IMDB reviews as positive or negative.  
- **Text Preprocessing**: Utilizes **tokenization**, **stemming**, and **TF-IDF vectorization** for effective text representation.  
- **Model Training**: Trained models such as **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression** to classify the sentiment of reviews.  
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved **90%+ accuracy** through model optimization and effective preprocessing.  

## Technologies  
- **Python** for text processing and model training.  
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning models and evaluation.  
- **NLTK** for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and stemming.  

## Results  
- **Accuracy**: Achieved **90%+ accuracy** in classifying IMDB reviews.  
- **Efficiency**: Optimized models to handle large text datasets with high efficiency.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of IMDB movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. [Provide the dataset link or mention its source, if applicable.]  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amhrahat/IMDB-Review-Sentiment-Classification.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash 
   cd IMDB-Review-Sentiment-Classification
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash 
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore and execute the code:
   ```bash 
   jupyter notebook imdb_sentiment_classification.ipynb
   
## Future Improvements  
- Experiment with deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for better performance on complex sentences.
- Improve preprocessing by adding lemmatization and removing stopwords. 
- Extend the model to handle multi-class sentiment classification.
